# Map Reduce using MRJob

This folder contains very simple implementations of __Map Reduce__
Algorithms using the awesome MRJob library.

The algorithm implementation is based on the wonderful book
[Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce](http://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/MapReduce-book-final.pdf)

All the data for running the examples is in the [data](./data) directory.

## Usage:

wordcount.py ./data/pg46.txt

average.py ./data/1901.txt

pairs_stripes.py ./data/bible_shakes.nopunc
